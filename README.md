# Uncertainty Quantification in Instrumental Variables Estimation
This is the R code for numerical analysis in the paper "Uncertainty Quantification in Instrumental Variables Estimation". To replicate the simulation results, readers need to set their own working direction and input the corresponding $h_{2}^{p}, h_{2}^{e}$ values as stated in the main paper.
* The sim.R file is the main code of our simulation.
* The sub.lsf is the submission file to server, readers can ignore it.
