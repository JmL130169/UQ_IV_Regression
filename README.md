# Uncertainty Quantification in Instrumental Variables Estimation
This is the R code for numerical analysis in the paper "Uncertainty Quantification in Instrumental Variables Estimation". To replicate the simulation results, readers need to set their own working direction and input the corresponding $h_{2}^{p}, h_{2}^{e}$ values as stated in the main paper.

In the direction "code", we have:
* "sim.R" is the main code of our simulation.
* "ComPACT_support_V20.R" is some necessary functions used in "sim.R"
* "sub.lsf" is the submission file to server, readers can ignore it.
